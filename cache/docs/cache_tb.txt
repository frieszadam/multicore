Cache Testbench Specification

Unit level testbench exercising valid cache states through directed stimulus.
Major testing requirements include:
- Cache misses
- Cache evictions
- Cache read/write sequences
- Cache snooping leading to invalidation and block state changes

Randomized test traces are generated via a Python framework using BSG trace replay system.
Test coverage and embedded assertions are included to improve verification certainty.

A software model is constructed of main memory and the cache itself to anticipate expected
results of memory transactions. Main memory holds what values should be returned from read
requests and the cache model allows prediction of cache misses and evictions.
