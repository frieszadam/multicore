Cache Specification

The cache is write-back and write-allocate, meaning it only writes data back to lower levels
upon eviction and loads blocks from memory upon write or read misses. A pseudo least-recently
used replacement policy is implemented and outstanding bus requests are tracked and responses
given in order.

The cache supports parameterizable block size, burst size, num_sets, and num_ways for reusability
and design space exploration.

During a write-allocate, the written block is detected and written in same process as storing the
loaded data to minimize latency. Similarily we store and directly forward read data following main
memory load. 

s_idle     : Awaiting request
s_lookup   : Checking loaded block for status, attempting first transmission if necessary
s_alloc_wr : Sending write transmissions
s_alloc_rd : Sending read transmissions and receiving read responses as they arrive
s_alloc_rx : Finish receiving read responses

Read request
we = 0
bus_req_type = write_allocate request? exclusive: shared
addr = rd_addr
wdata = 'x

Write back request
we = 1
bus_req_type = 0
addr = wr_addr
wdata = wdata

Write invalidate request
we = 0
bus_req_type = exclusive
addr = wd_addr
wdata = 'x

write down
load exclusive
load shared
upgrade to exclusive (write invalidate)

cb_ld_ex_i indicates no conflicts with other blocks so can be loaded as exclusive, only used for
ld_shared req_type as other reqs mandate the final cache state.
