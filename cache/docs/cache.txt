Cache Specification

The cache is write-back and write-allocate, meaning it only writes data back to lower levels
upon eviction and loads blocks from memory upon write or read misses. A pseudo least-recently
used replacement policy is implemented and outstanding bus requests are tracked and responses
given in order.

The cache supports parameterizable block size, burst size, num_sets, and num_ways for reusability
and design space exploration.
