** Cache Specification **
The cache is write-back and write-allocate, meaning it only writes data back to lower levels
upon eviction and handles write misses by loading the entire block.
The cache supports parameterizable block size, burst size, num_sets, and num_ways.
It implements a least-recently used replacement policy, though this will be implemented later.
Outstanding bus requests are tracked and responses must be given in order.

On snoop line we must sense write-invalidates, read and write requests.
If in exclusive and see read or write request, move to shared or
