** Cache Testbench Specification **
Unit level testbench exercising valid cache states through directed stimulus.
Major testing requirements include:
- Cache misses
- Cache evictions
- Cache read/write sequences
- Cache snooping leading to invalidation and block state changes

Randomized test traces will be generated via a Python framework using BSG trace replay system.
Test coverage and embedded assertions are included to improve verification certainty.

On the software side we can expect create a model of main memory and the cache itself.
Main memory holds what values should be returned from read requests.
The cache model allows prediction of memory requests as we will know if a block is loaded
or if the set is full and should thus expect an eviction.
