Bus Specification

The bus coordinates communication between main memory and all outer processor caches by
fairly arbitrating requests. Burst data access is enabled in the case that the dma_tx 
size is less than the cache block size - to do this the bus tracks ongoing transactions
and forwards these without rearbitration. 

The bus also provides the location for caches to snoop on main memory transactions which
is vital for cache coherency.
